My TODOs
--------

Out of order.

- [V] Basic atlas rendering
- [V] Basic input-layer
- [V] Hot-reload gameplay code
- [V] Hot-reload assets (draft)
- [ ] Unify asset hot-reload system (make it so you define assets to load and track them changing on disk
- [ ] Sine-wave play with XAudio2 (or DirectSound?)
- [ ] Play .wav files with XAudio2
- [ ] Rework sprite rendering from atlas: make it so you can index sprites in atlas more easly (and hot-reload it)
- [ ] Sprite collision
- [ ] Tilemap rendering (map)
- [ ] Rework input system? I don't like that platform-layer defines changes for Input_State
- [ ] Implement gamepad support (with DirectInput, like in `gr3yknigh1/gfs`)
- [ ] Bring some kind of UI library (like ImGUI)
- [ ] Text rendering (brobably with freetype library)
